            <h3>Who We Are</h3><br>
            <p style = font-size:large>Founded over 15 years ago, Art for All is a community group which aims to provide independent and affordable art classes to adults who suffer with mental health issues.
            
            Our emphasis is on providing a supportive, safe and sociable space, where people can learn and build both new and existing artistic skills. <br><br> As members of Art for All we encourage people to view themselves as artists and not allow their mental health issue to define them, instead, we encourage them to recognise their potential and how being creative helps to promote both short-term and long-term well-being.
            
            <br><br>We run weekly sessions where we practice drawing, painting and printmaking, as well as holding exhibitions in various venues, visiting tutors who run workshops and visit art galleries.
            
            We are fortunate to have the long-term loan of a large Art room in Cheltenham from Independence Trust, with whom we enjoy a supportive relationship.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3><br>
        <p style="font-size: large;"> Art for All's mission is to provide arts provisions for those who suffer with mental health issues.</p>
        <p style ="font-size: large">All artistic ability and ambition will be recognised, respected, and encouraged.</p>
        <p style ="font-size: large">This is achieved by providing a safe, inclusive social space, good quality arts materials, opportunities, and tuition where it's wanted, alongside support from peers and tutors. This in turn
        enables individuals to see their own value as people and as artists, so that they cannot be defined by their mental health situation.</p><br>

     <!-- <p style ="font-size: large;"class= "text-muted">Art for All has given me a safe space where I can be myself. It makes such a difference to have somewhere where I can focus on art and nothing else. I don't have to worry or think about the world or my problems, just something
       that makes me feel happy and accomplished. I love Shelley's support, encouragement and guidance, and am truly grateful.
